# Week 2 Advanced CSS Homework

## Description
    This is the initial HTML/CSS mock-up of what will become my portfolio page. It contains a navigation bar that moves the user around the page itself, a picture of me, stand-in images for what will become links to projects, and working links to my Linkedin and GitHub as well as a link to email me directly.

## Function
    The navbar contains images as <a> elements with tooltips, through the title attribute in HTML5, that move the user to the corresponding portion of the page. The stand-in images for the projects section are animated gifs. When the user hovers over the cards, they have an inset shadow. When the user clicks on the cards, they flash a white background. The Linkedin and GitHub pages take the user directly to the corresponding webpages, and the Email link opens the user's default email application.
